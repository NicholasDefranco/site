# My Website

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/nick-cd/site.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/nick-cd/site)

Source code for my personal website!

## How to Use

This Website uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), thus, you must have it
[installed](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).

Once installed, run this command:

```bash
make serve
```

To start the web server on localhost:4000.  The site will update automatically
upon making changes to the source code.
