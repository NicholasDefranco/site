# My Website!

![build](https://travis-ci.com/NicholasDefranco/NicholasDefranco.github.io.svg?token=k3ifBQMTCrajkGsSXC9S&branch=master&status=passed)

Welcome to my personal website's source code!

### How to Use

This Website is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), thus, you must have it installed.  
Take a look [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) to find out how to install.

Once installed, simply run this command:
```
bundle exec Jekyll serve
```
to start the webserver on localhost:4000.  
The site will update automatically upon making changes to the source code.
